hey there!

wanna learn react and it's looking very complex and difficult?

worry no more. follow these steps below to become more familiar with coding/react!

## first step: setup nextjs baseline
do this on terminal
```
npx create-next-app@latest . 
```

if it asks you questions, just hit enter for everything, but choose TypeScript if it gives you the option!

## second step: start dev server

run 
``` 
npm run dev
``` 
on terminal, this should start up a local server for you to play around with! click on the first localhost link to see live-updates to ur website :)

## third step: dora the explorer

look around the project's structure and try to familiarize yourself with it. when you open the localhost, what you see is code from pages/index.tsx, and if you want you can try playing around with it and see what happens!

## fourth step: baby's first react component

create a folder called components in the main directory, and under it create a file called "about.tsx".

in about.tsx we'll be talking about the developer of the website (you!), an example of a simple component that does this is:

```
export default function About() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>about the dev </h1>
      <p>I'm YOUR NAME and this is my first react component!!!!!!</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

you can customize further if you know some html already, but if not, it's fine.

moving on, go back to pages/index.tsx, and in there you can call your beautiful component. 

the way you call it is:

1. write this at the beginning of index
```
import About from "@/components/about";
```
2. anywhere within the return portion for index call you component like this
```
<About />
``` 

there! you created ur first react component and mildly understand react!

## future steps:

1. learning how to use usestate and useeffect
2. add styles to make it look better
3. create other components
